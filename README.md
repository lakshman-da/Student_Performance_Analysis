# Student_Performance_Analysis
📚 Student Performance Analysis
Welcome to the Student Performance Analysis project! 🎓 This project delves into the various demographic and socio-economic factors that affect student outcomes using a data-driven approach. By combining Python-based EDA, SQL queries, and statistical methods, the project aims to reveal patterns that could be crucial for educators, parents, and policymakers.

🧠 Objectives
Understand key factors that influence student performance.
Explore the dataset through visualizations and correlations.
Use SQL for efficient data querying and manipulation.
Perform statistical tests to draw meaningful inferences.
Create a modular and well-documented project structure for future scalability.
🔍 Dataset Overview
We use the Student Performance Dataset from Kaggle, which includes:

Gender
Race/ethnicity
Parental level of education
Lunch type
Test preparation course
Math, reading, and writing scores
This structured and labeled dataset is ideal for both exploratory and predictive analysis.

🧰 Technologies & Tools
Category	Tools Used
Language	Python, SQL
Data Handling	Pandas, NumPy
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistics	SciPy, Statsmodels
Environment	Jupyter Notebook
Database	MySQL / PostgreSQL
📈 Analysis Highlights
Parental education strongly correlates with student performance.
Students who completed test prep scored higher across all subjects.
Gender differences are more pronounced in math scores (males slightly ahead).
📊 Statistical Tests Performed
T-tests between students with vs. without test prep
ANOVA on performance across race/ethnicity
